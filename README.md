## Overview
This project is a recreation of Minesweeper in Processing. In Minesweeper, there is a board of squares. Some of these squares are mines. The goal is to click on all of the squares that are not mines. Clicking on a square that isn't a mine either reveals how many mines it's neighboring or reveals squares in each direction, including diagonals, until it reveals a square that neighbors at least one mine.
